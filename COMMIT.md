Export text content to MD
1. Created 2 functions, createMDFile() and writeToMDFile()
2. createMDFile() creates the file and adds some starter text, namely the title, author, and timestamp
3. writeToMDFIle() accepts chapter_content as input and loops through each item, writing it onto the file in a specified format
4. Pretty much done with this then
