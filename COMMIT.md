Fetch [data-test-id="audio-player"] from input HTML
1. Alright as a sad little compromise, as planned, I have the page contents copy-and-pasted manually onto a input/page.html file, and the scraper fetches the data from that
2. It's sucky, sure, but beats having to manually copy-paste the contents straight from the page selectively and multiple times, as well as downloading the audio file and renaming all of it
